In NumPy, 
1D array have 1 axis, i.e., Axis 0

2D array have 2 axis, i.e., Axis 0 & Axis 1
-> Axis 0 spans through rows
-> Axis 1 spans through columns

Eg:
     -> axis 1

   [[1, 2, 3],   sum = 6   -> as per axis 1
    [4, 5, 6],   sum = 15  -> as per axis 1
    [7, 1, 0]]   sum = 8   -> as per axis 1
    
     |  |  |
sum=12  8  9
as per axis 0
